# Regular bracket strings
Regular bracket strings, also called Dyck words, are defined as follows:
- An empty string is a regular bracket string
- If you have a regular bracket string, you can put a `(` in front and `)` at the end of the string to make another regular bracket string
- If you have two regular bracket strings, you can concatenate them together to make another regular bracket string

There are many competitive programming problems about regular bracket strings. Every competitive programming problem about regular bracket strings is a novel snowflake.
